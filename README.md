We came up with Jobseekr for our introductory one-week Rails project to provide an alternative job engine that wouldn't necessarily compete against job engines that we're borrowing APIs from, but to harness all of their collective result listing dumps into one source - Jobseekr.

Above anything else, Jobseekr was our team's first major dive into Rails over at Flatiron and with that - data modeling, middleware, action controllers, asset pipeline, action view helpers, and lots of debugging.

As a one week project, time was a very limited resources for us, and this website is far from perfect.

<li>In the future, we would like to integrate company portal to post job opening and looking for employees through our website</li>
<li>we would really love to refactor and change the search algorithm and make it much faster and better for user experience</li>

In closing, we hope you enjoy searching with Jobseekr!
